To develop the Smart Expense Tracker, a range of tools were used, each playing a vital role in handling the frontend, backend, database, and AI functionalities of the project.
For the frontend development, HTML and CSS were used to design the structure and layout of the user interface, ensuring that it is clean, responsive, and user-friendly. JavaScript was used to handle client-side logic, enabling dynamic interactions and seamless communication with the backend server.
On the backend, the application was built using Node.js, which offers a fast and scalable environment for executing server-side code and handling API requests efficiently.
For data storage, PostgreSQL was selected as the relational database management system. It was used to maintain structured data related to groups, participants, expenses, and payments. phpPgAdmin was utilized during development to manage, visualize, and interact with the PostgreSQL database through a web-based interface.
A key highlight of the project is the integration of Artificial Intelligence, specifically Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This feature was implemented using Python along with the Tesseract OCR library, allowing the system to automatically extract text from uploaded receipts or images and convert them into expense entries with minimal user input.
Python with libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and joblib for model training and deployment. Flask is used to server the categorization API for integration with the main application.
Additionally, tools include Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the primary code editor for writing and organizing the codebase.
